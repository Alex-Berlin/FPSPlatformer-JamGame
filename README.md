# [PLATFORM]er
### Description
Simple first person game created in a two(actually one) weeks for a jam. I didn't had enough time to finish it fully, so the end result is downscaled a lot. The idea is that player uses dynamic activatable platform to move around the levels and solve puzzles, but in the end it's just one semi-open world level with collectibles.
<br>It uses simple physics-based first person controller, stationary enemy turrets and grappling hook mechanic.
<br>
Made in Unity 2019.4.8f1, models are created in Blender.
Feel free to use the code however you like.

# Controls:
LMB for attacking
<br>Air at colored platform and press RMB to activate it.
<br>WASD and SPACE for movement.
