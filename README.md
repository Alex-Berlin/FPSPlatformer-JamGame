# FPSPlatformer JamGame

Simple first person game created in a two(actually one) weeks for a jam. I didn't had enough time to finish it fully, so the end result is downscaled a lot. The idea is that player uses dynamic activatable platform to move around the levels and solve puzzles, but in the end it's just one semi-open world level with collectibles.

Made in Unity 2019.4.8f1, models are created in Blender.
Feel free to use the code, if you like.

Controls:
LMB for attacking
Air at colored platform and press RMB to activate it.
WASD and SPACE for movement.
